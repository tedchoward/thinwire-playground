	                     About ThinWire(R) Playground Demo	
===============================================================================
The Playground Demo allows you to interact with most of the UI components that
ThinWire(R) includes. When we say interact, we're not talking about just being
able to look at a component and click on a button or two. Playground goes
beyond the basics in a number of ways:

    * Select a component and the applicable help file is available
    * Modify component properties and styles and see the result
    * Acivate event listeners and see real-time event output
    * Generate source code for the exact component you've configured
